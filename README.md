Diabetes and Heart Disease Predictor
Technologies Used: Python, Pickle, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit

Description:
This machine learning web app predicts the likelihood of diabetes and heart disease using models trained on health data. It initially uses a Logistic Regression model but was later improved with a Support Vector Machine for better prediction efficiency.

Features:
Machine Learning Models: Includes Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models.
Data Handling: Uses NumPy and Pandas for data processing.
Model Persistence: Pickle used for saving and loading trained models.
Streamlit Deployment: Easy-to-use web interface for predictions.
